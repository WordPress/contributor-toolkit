/**
 * Applying and reverting a patch, driven through the app (#361).
 *
 * The other half of a contributor's day: someone else's work arrives as a patch
 * file or a pull request, and it has to go onto the checkout and come off again
 * without taking anything of theirs with it. #350 changes what "applied" means —
 * today it is a layer the app holds, afterwards it is a commit — so what is
 * pinned here is the part that must survive either model.
 *
 * Assertions are marked INVARIANT or CHARACTERISATION; see ticket-branches.spec.js
 * for what the distinction buys during that refactor.
 *
 * The patch arrives from a local file through the app's own file dialog, answered
 * from the test. Nothing here fetches a pull request: that would put a third
 * party in the path of a test that is about the checkout.
