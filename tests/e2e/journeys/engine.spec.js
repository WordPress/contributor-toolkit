/**
 * The engine's own test (#360).
 *
 * Not a journey: it asserts nothing about ticket branches or patches. It asserts
 * that the four things every journey depends on actually work, so that when a
 * journey fails it is about the flow and not about the harness.
 *
 *   1. The app launches from the source tree and paints.
 *   2. It uses the throwaway profile, and nothing else.
 *   3. What it persists survives closing and reopening it.
 *   4. A native file dialog can be answered from the test.
 *
 * If this file is red, no other journey's result means anything.
