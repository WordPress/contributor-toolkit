//   journeys  drives the *source tree* through the flows a contributor performs by
//             hand — link a ticket, apply a patch, switch branches. Fast, offline,
//             and it writes real state to a throwaway profile.
//   packaged  launches the *packaged artifact* (`electron-builder --dir`) and only
//             asks whether packaging worked. It writes no state.
//
// They are not interchangeable: the journeys mutate real Git repositories and need
// to be quick enough to run in a loop, and the packaging failures — asar layout,
// native module rebuilds, bundled CLI resolution — do not reproduce from source.
