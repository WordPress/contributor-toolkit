// The content column's width cap, and the screenshot that proves it works.
//
// This is a string assertion guarding something a reviewer will not catch by
// eye, for the same reason as color-scheme.test.cjs: the failure is invisible
// on the machine most people look at it on. The default screenshot window is
// 1200px wide with a 281px sidebar (280 plus its right border), which leaves a
// content area of 855px — the width every cropped panel screenshot in
// docs/public/screenshots/ comes out at, and narrower than the 880px cap. So at
// the size every other image is taken,
// removing the cap entirely changes nothing. Every PNG in the docs would look
// correct while the app ran headings and meta lines to the edge of a maximised
// window.
//
// Two things are pinned here. The cap itself, and the wide screenshot that is
// the only image able to show it. Deleting the shot would leave the cap
// working but unphotographed, which is the state this test was written to end.
