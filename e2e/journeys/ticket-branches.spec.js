/**
 * Ticket branches, driven through the app (#361).
 *
 * The flow a contributor performs by hand at a Contributor Day: link a ticket,
 * edit something, link a second ticket, come back to the first. It is the flow
 * #350 moves wholesale, and the one whose failures are silent — the app does not
 * report work it quietly failed to restore.
 *
 * Assertions are marked as one of two kinds, and the distinction is the point of
 * the file:
 *
 *   INVARIANT      must hold under any model of how the app stores work. If one
 *                  of these goes red during #350, something is broken.
 *   CHARACTERISATION  true because of how the app stores things today. If one of
 *                  these goes red during #350, read it, decide whether the new
 *                  model is what you meant, and update it deliberately.
 *
 * Nothing here asserts on the ticket's Trac or pull-request panels. Linking a
 * ticket does start a GitHub lookup for its pull requests, so the app really
 * does reach the network at that moment — but an assertion that depends on a
 * third party being reachable is a flake waiting for a Monday morning, and none
 * of these need one. Trac itself is only read when the contributor asks for it.
