# Automated review rules

What an automated reviewer should look for in this repo, and how to run that review. Written to be
read by any agent, not one in particular — this is the single source of truth for the review
standard, and it is deliberately the only copy of it.

`AGENTS.md` and `.claude/skills/self-review/SKILL.md` point here rather than restate it. Copilot
needs no pointer: it reads `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` natively, selecting them by
matching the `applyTo` glob above against the files in a pull request, so `**` means every PR gets
this. That is the whole reason the file lives at this path and not somewhere better-named — a
pointer would not have reached it, and a second condensed copy would have drifted.

The procedure below assumes an agent that can run commands. Copilot cannot; it should skip to
**Scope** and treat the rest as the standard to review against.

Nothing runs this automatically. It is the author's pass, before a human reads the diff — which is
the point: a finding fixed now costs one message, the same finding on the PR costs a review cycle.
The producer is responsible for handing over a reviewable change, not the reviewer for
reconstructing the context.

## Running the review

**1. Establish the diff.**

```bash
git fetch origin trunk
git diff --stat origin/trunk...HEAD
git diff origin/trunk...HEAD
```

Include uncommitted work if there is any (`git status --short`, `git diff`) — the author is about
to commit it, so it is in scope.

**2. Run the deterministic layer first**, so mechanical findings never reach the judgement pass:

```bash
npm run lint
npm test
```

Both are repo-wide and both are clean on `trunk` — the lint backlog was cleared in #117, which is
why `lint.yml` runs `eslint .` rather than linting only the changed files. So any failure here
belongs to the branch. Report both results plainly.

If ESLint fails, `npm run lint:fix` handles the mechanical part. Check what it rewrote before
committing: it is also repo-wide, so a rule that starts flagging untouched files would pull them
into the diff. Do not hand-fix what the fixer handles.

**3. Review the five dimensions below.** Read the surrounding files, not just the diff — a diff
rarely shows that a helper already handles the case, and the reporting bar requires verifying a
finding before asserting it.

Where the tool allows it, run this pass with fresh context — a subagent given the diff and this
file, rather than the session that wrote the code. Nothing runs this review independently any more,
so a reviewer that already believes the change is correct is the main way it stops working.

**4. Report, then offer.** Format below. Ask before changing anything: the author decides what is a
real finding, which is the whole reason this happens before the PR rather than after.

## Scope

Review **judgement**, not style. ESLint (`eslint.config.mjs`, `npm run lint`) already covers
formatting, unused variables, JSDoc, React hooks and the rest of the mechanical layer. Repeating
those here buries the findings that matter. When style and process nits share space with
substantive findings, authors learn to skim past them — and the substantive findings go with
them.

Five dimensions, in priority order: **architecture · security · performance · cross-platform ·
tests**.

## What this app is

An Electron app that sets up a `wordpress-develop` environment with **zero prerequisites** — no
Git, Node, npm or Docker on the host. Everything runs as JS/WASM inside the Electron process. Its
users are Contributor Day newcomers on macOS and Windows, often on locked-down machines.

That premise is what most of the rules below protect. A change that quietly reintroduces a host
dependency defeats the entire point of the project.

---

## 1. Architecture

Invariants. Breaking one is a `[fix here]` finding even when the code works on the author's
machine.

**Child processes run on Electron's bundled Node, never the host's.** Spawns go through
`process.execPath` with `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` in the environment (see `runNpmWithEngineRetry`
and the `playground:start` handler in `src/main.js`, and `buildChildEnv`). A bare `spawn('node')`
or `spawn('npm')` assumes a host toolchain that is not there. On Windows child `npm` processes
find a `node` at all only because of the `PATH` shim built by `ensureNodeShimDir` — new spawns
must inherit that environment rather than build their own.

**Git never shells out.** All Git operations go through `isomorphic-git`. Patch and diff
generation is hand-rolled in `src/main.js` (stage untracked files, diff working tree against
`origin/trunk`) precisely because there is no `git` binary to call. Any `spawn('git')` or
`exec('git ...')` is a regression.

**`electron-store` is the only persistence layer.** No database, no sidecar JSON. It holds the
site registry and per-site metadata and is the single source of truth for "known sites". A second
store, a cache file, or state parked in a module-level variable that outlives a handler is
architectural drift — flag it.

**Long-running output streams; it is not returned.** Installs, scripts and the Playground server
push output to the renderer through correlated IDs (`installId`, `runId`, `sitePath`) over
dedicated channels. See the handler pairs in `src/preload.js`. A new long-running operation that
resolves its `invoke()` with accumulated output instead of streaming will look fine on a fast
machine and hang the UI on a slow one.

**The renderer↔main boundary is fixed.** New surface means a `contextBridge` entry in
`src/preload.js` plus an `ipcMain.handle` in `src/main.js`. `contextIsolation: true` and
`nodeIntegration: false` are set on every `BrowserWindow` — the main window and both patch
windows — and are not negotiable. Flag any window created without them, and any attempt to widen
the bridge by exposing `ipcRenderer` itself rather than named functions.

**Failure paths are part of the architecture.** The users cannot debug: a swallowed error is
"the button did nothing" at a Contributor Day, with nobody able to diagnose it. Every spawn
handles both `error` and `close` — Node documents that exit events "may or may not" follow a
spawn failure, and `runNpmWithEngineRetry` in `src/main.js` shows the expected shape. No silent
`catch`: an error that never reaches the renderer's log stream did not happen, from the user's
chair. And a setup that dies halfway must leave the site registry consistent — no phantom site
in `electron-store` for a directory that was never finished.

**New dependencies are findings by default.** Native compilation or a host binary breaks the
zero-prerequisite promise on user machines. A dependency with lifecycle scripts also needs an
`allowScripts` entry in `package.json` — the mechanism already exists, and a missing entry means
its install scripts silently don't run.

**Changing the shape of what `electron-store` holds needs a migration path.** Existing users
have site registries on disk; a renamed or restructured key silently orphans their sites.

## 2. Security

The threat model is not a hostile user — it is a contributor's laptop on a conference or café
network, running a WordPress with `admin`/`admin`.

**Validate what crosses IPC.** Every `ipcMain.handle` argument comes from the renderer and is
untrusted input. Paths get used for file operations, URLs get opened.

> Worked example, kept because it shows the shape rather than a single bug: `url:open` in
> `src/main.js` used to pass its argument straight to `shell.openExternal()`, so `file://` and
> `javascript:` got through to the OS handler. It now goes through `src/external-url.js`, which
> refuses anything outside an http/https allow-list and — the part that is easy to miss — hands
> the OS the *parsed* address rather than the caller's string, because the URL parser strips
> control characters and a validator that checks one string while the caller opens another has
> not checked anything. Look for both halves in any new handler that takes a URL or a path.

**Servers stay on loopback.** `src/bind-loopback.js` patches `net.Server.prototype.listen` so
Playground's servers bind to `127.0.0.1` instead of every interface. Any new listener that is
created before that patch is applied, or that passes an explicit non-loopback host, exposes the
contributor's site to the local network. This is what the file exists to prevent — read its
header comment before deciding a change is safe.

**Never `shell: true`.** Existing spawns pass `shell: false` deliberately. A shell turns any
path containing a space or a quote into a command-injection vector, and contributor directory
names are user-chosen. The Windows `.cmd` shim path in `src/win-spawn-patch.js` is the one
audited exception; new code should not add another.

**No secrets in the repo, and none in logs.** Pay particular attention to
`scripts/azure-sign.cjs` and `fastlane/`. Signing credentials arrive as environment variables and
must not be echoed into child-process output, which is streamed to the renderer and written to
disk by `electron-log`.

**Untrusted archives and downloads.** Anything unzipped or fetched into a user directory should
be checked for path traversal (`../` in archive entries) before extraction.

## 3. Performance

**The main process must not block.** It runs the UI. Synchronous filesystem calls, large
`JSON.parse`, or hashing on a path that a handler can reach will freeze the whole window. `fs`
sync calls during startup or inside an `ipcMain.handle` deserve a flag; the same call in a
one-shot build script does not.

**Log output is unbounded by nature.** `npm install` on `wordpress-develop` produces a lot of it.
Watch for per-chunk work that is quadratic, and for buffers that accumulate the full output with
no ceiling — see `src/log-lines.js` for how line splitting is done today.

**Work should not scale with the site registry.** Anything that walks every known site, or stats
every directory, on each render or each IPC call will degrade as a contributor accumulates sites.

Flag performance only where there is a plausible path to a user noticing it. Speculative
micro-optimisation is noise.

## 4. Cross-platform

macOS and Windows are the primary targets; Linux artifacts are published too. CI runs the unit
suite on macOS and Windows, but plenty gets past it.

**Paths.** Compose with `path.join` / `path.resolve`, never string concatenation with `/`. Do not
compare paths case-sensitively — Windows and default macOS filesystems are case-insensitive. Do
not assume a path has no spaces; contributors pick their own directories.

**Killing processes is platform-split.** POSIX relies on the child being a process-group leader
(`detached: true`) so the whole tree can be signalled; Windows uses `taskkill /T`. Both live in
`src/kill-tree.js`. A new spawn that does not set `detached` correctly, or that is terminated with
a bare `child.kill()`, will leave orphaned processes on one platform or the other.

**Windows specifics.** Executables need their extension (`.cmd`, `.bat`, `.exe`) resolved;
`windowsHide: true` keeps console windows from flashing; `EPERM` and `EINVAL` have
Windows-specific causes. `src/win-spawn-patch.js` documents the traps that have already bitten —
consult it rather than re-deriving them.

**Line endings** matter when generating patches, which are destined for Trac.

**Electron's Node version is a real constraint.** It is set independently of `.nvmrc` and the two
have drifted before (issues #37 / #46), which is why the suite runs twice. A change that depends
on a newer Node API needs to hold on whichever of the two is older.

## 5. Tests

**A new feature or bugfix without a test is a finding.** Not a suggestion in a footer — a
finding, with the same severity-and-scope labelling as everything else. The suite is
`node --test` over `test/*.test.cjs`; new tests follow the patterns already there.

**A bugfix's test must reproduce the bug**: fail on the old code, pass on the new. A test
written after the fix that never saw the bug proves far less — it pins the current behaviour,
whatever that is, rather than the correction. When reviewing a bugfix, check whether the test
would actually have caught it.

**Watch for tests that are green while proving nothing.** The known shapes in this repo:

- Mocking the very thing the test claims to verify.
- Asserting implementation details — exact log strings, call order of internals — instead of
  observable behaviour. These break on harmless refactors and survive real bugs.
- Passing on only one of the two Node runtimes. CI runs the suite on `.nvmrc`'s Node *and* on
  Electron's bundled Node because the two are set independently and have drifted; a test (or the
  code under it) that assumes the newer of the two is broken on the other.

**Platform-conditional code needs both branches tested — from one machine.** The house pattern
is dependency injection, not skipping: `test/win-spawn-patch.test.cjs` exercises the Windows
paths from macOS by injecting `platform`, lookup and env rather than reading `process.platform`.
A new platform split tested with `it.skip` on the other OS is a coverage hole CI will never
close, since the suite runs on both platforms but each skips the other's branch.

**Scope stays proportional.** Missing tests on a touched line of legacy code is `[follow-up]`,
not `[fix here]` — the strong rule applies to what the PR introduces, not to everything it
brushes against.

---

## How to report

**Every finding carries a dimension, a severity and a scope.**

- Scope is `[fix here]` or `[follow-up]`. Use `[follow-up]` for cross-cutting refactors and
  anything the PR did not introduce. This gives the author a defensible "noted, separate PR"
  rather than a finding that looks ignored.
- Severity: 🔴 high, 🟡 medium, 🔵 low.

**Structure**: counts first (`2 [fix here] · 1 [follow-up]`), then one finding per entry carrying
its dimension, severity, scope, `file:line`, and what actually goes wrong. Style and process
observations go last, grouped and brief — never mixed in among the findings.

Where this runs before the PR exists, that report goes in the chat: no GitHub comments, no files
written. Where it runs on a PR, `[fix here]` findings become inline comments on the exact lines and
the counts go in a single summary comment, with the style notes in a collapsed `<details>` block.

**On a re-run, reconcile — do not re-review from scratch.** Mark each earlier finding resolved,
still open, or obsolete. Re-asserting a fixed finding is the fastest way to get the whole review
ignored.

**Say when there is nothing.** "No findings across the five dimensions" in one line is a good
review. Do not pad. Do not restate what the PR does — the author knows.

**Verify before claiming.** Read the surrounding file before asserting an invariant is broken;
the diff alone often does not show that a helper already handles the case. A confident wrong
finding costs more than a missed one.

**Never approve, request changes, or merge.** Post comments only. The human decides.
