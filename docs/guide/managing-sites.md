# Managing sites

Everything about a site's identity and lifecycle lives in its header: the name, a few status badges, the path, and the **More** menu (☰) at the top right.

## The site header

- **Rename** — click the pencil icon next to the site title to give the site a different display name. This changes the label in the app only; the directory on disk keeps its name.
- **Status badge** — **INITIALIZED** once the repository is cloned; **UNINITIALIZED** before that.
- **Created date** — when the site was created.
- **Trunk age** — how old the site's snapshot of `wordpress-develop` trunk is. When the snapshot gets stale, an amber dot appears next to the label; hover it to see the age in days. See [Staying up to date with trunk](./trunk-updates).
- **Path** — the site's directory, with a copy button next to it. The **Open directory in** menu underneath opens it in your file manager or an editor; see [Editors](./editors).

## The More menu

The ☰ menu at the top right of the site view contains:

- **Copy path** — puts the site's directory path on the clipboard.
- **Show in Finder** (macOS) / **Show in Explorer** (Windows) — reveals the directory in your file manager.
- **Update to latest trunk** — fetches the latest `wordpress-develop` trunk and rebuilds. Also reachable from the staleness notice; on an already-fresh site it just prints "Already up to date." See [Staying up to date with trunk](./trunk-updates).
- **Delete this site** — removes the site from the list **and deletes its directory from disk**. This cannot be undone. The app will only ever delete a directory it has on record as a site — never an arbitrary path. It takes every ticket's work in the site with it; to throw away one ticket and keep the rest, use **Delete this ticket's work** on the tickets card instead — see [Working on several tickets](./ticket-branches#deleting-a-ticket-s-work).

**Delete** asks for confirmation first.

## Updating with uncommitted changes

If you start **Update to latest trunk** while the site has edits loose in the working tree, the app does not silently throw them away. A dialog titled **Update to latest trunk?** lists every changed file and offers two choices:

- **Save them as a patch first (as a local file)** — writes a `.diff` to your machine, then updates. Nothing is sent to Trac.
- **Discard them** — your changes are lost; this cannot be undone.

Confirm with **Save patch & update** or **Discard & update**, or **Cancel** to keep everything as it is. If you meant to keep the changes as a contribution instead, see [Submitting your changes](./submitting-changes).

Work that is already parked on a ticket branch is never what this dialog is offering to discard — the update carries it across untouched. See [Updating while you are on a ticket](./trunk-updates#updating-while-you-are-on-a-ticket).
