## Download stats

The app is distributed as release binaries, so downloads are the only usage signal there is — there is no npm install count, no Docker pull count, no telemetry in the app.

GitHub reports a running total per release asset and keeps **no history**: the API returns the number as it stands today and nothing about how it got there. So a [weekly workflow](.github/workflows/download-stats.yml) records that total and commits it to [`metrics`](https://github.com/WordPress/contributor-toolkit/tree/metrics), an orphan branch that shares no history with `trunk` and holds nothing but the data files.

This page describes how the numbers are collected and read, not what they are. The figures themselves live on `metrics`, so they never go stale here.

### Reading the data

In the browser: [downloads.csv](https://github.com/WordPress/contributor-toolkit/blob/metrics/downloads.csv).

Locally, without switching branches:

```bash
git fetch origin metrics:metrics
git show metrics:downloads.csv
```

One row per asset per snapshot, so any release can be broken down by platform:

```csv
date,tag,asset,downloads,asset_id
2026-09-07,"v1.0.1","wordpress-contributor-toolkit-1.0.1-mac-arm64.dmg",12,293445711
2026-09-07,"v1.0.0","wordpress-contributor-toolkit-1.0.0-win-x64.exe",31,281129055
```

`asset_id` is GitHub's own id for the uploaded file, and it is what makes a replaced file legible: the counter belongs to the upload, not to the name, so the same filename re-uploaded is a new id starting again at zero. Snapshots taken before that column existed have four fields and keep them.

**The number is cumulative per asset, not per week.** Two consecutive rows for the same asset are running totals; subtract them to get the change between those dates.

A few things the data answers directly:

```bash
# Raw total across every release on the most recent snapshot, prereleases included and
# withdrawn assets forgotten, that is, the number the badge deliberately does not show
git show metrics:downloads.csv | awk -F, -v d="$(git show metrics:downloads.csv | tail -1 | cut -d, -f1)" \
  '$1 == d { gsub(/"/, "", $4); sum += $4 } END { print sum }'

# One asset over time
git show metrics:downloads.csv | grep 'mac-arm64.dmg'
```

### The badge

`badge.json`, on the same branch, holds the number the README badge shows, in the format a [shields.io endpoint badge](https://shields.io/badges/endpoint-badge) reads. It is **not** the total GitHub reports, and it is deliberately neither the larger nor the smaller number:

- **Stable tags only.** Release candidates and betas are excluded, by the `-` in the tag rather than by GitHub's `prerelease` flag. A download of `rc.1` a month after 1.0.0 shipped is not somebody adopting the app.
- **`v0.1.1` is the exception, and the reason the flag is not used.** That tag is titled "v0.1.1 draft" and GitHub published it as a prerelease, never as a release. But its three assets are the v0.1.0 binaries (`…Setup.0.1.0.exe`, `…-0.1.0.AppImage`, `…-0.1.0-arm64.dmg`), so their 42 downloads are downloads of the app as it then stood and count as v0.1.0's. Filtering on GitHub's flag would drop them.
- **Withdrawn assets still count.** An asset that disappears from the snapshots keeps whatever it had earned. Four macOS `.dmg` files on the shipped releases were replaced when the signing key was rotated, and the live API now reports nothing for the 89 downloads that preceded that. Three more went with them on the prerelease tags, worth another 9 that the badge does not count anyway.
- **A re-upload is a new asset, not a correction.** The replacement is counted on top of what the old file had, matched by `asset_id` rather than by guessing from a counter that went down. A counter that does go down is bad data and fails the run, because GitHub cannot produce one.

[`scripts/download-total.cjs`](scripts/download-total.cjs) does this, over the whole of `downloads.csv`, every time the workflow runs. To reproduce it:

```bash
git show metrics:downloads.csv > downloads.csv
node scripts/download-total.cjs downloads.csv
```

The consequence worth knowing: the badge moves once a week, when the workflow runs, not the moment someone downloads something.

### What the numbers are not

**They count HTTP requests, not people.** A re-download, a `curl` in a CI script, a retry after a dropped connection and a bot crawling the releases page each add one. Treat them as an interest signal, not an install count.

**Source archives and clones are not included.** Only uploaded release assets are counted — the auto-generated `.zip`/`.tar.gz` and `git clone` are not.

**The counter belongs to the asset, not the release.** Deleting a release file and re-uploading it restarts that file at zero, which is part of why these snapshots exist: they are the only record that survives a rename. It has already happened once, to the three artifacts replaced while v0.1.2 was still a draft, and again to the macOS `.dmg` files when the signing key was rotated. Since the snapshots record `asset_id`, a future one is visible rather than merely suspected.

**History starts when the workflow did.** Everything before the first snapshot is unrecoverable — GitHub never stored it.
