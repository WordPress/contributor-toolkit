// Summing today's `download_count` across today's assets, which is what a live shields badge
// does, gets the number wrong twice over.
//
// It undercounts, because the counter belongs to the asset and dies with it. Four macOS `.dmg`
// files on the shipped releases were deleted and re-uploaded when the signing key was rotated,
// so 89 downloads that really happened are gone from the API. They survive only in the snapshots, which is the whole
// reason the snapshots exist.
//
// And it overcounts, because it includes release candidates and betas. A download of `rc.1` two
// months after 1.0.0 shipped is not somebody adopting the app, and counting it as adoption is
// the kind of flattery that makes the number worth nothing.
//
// So the badge counts stable tags only, and counts every download an asset ever recorded,
// including after the asset itself is gone.
