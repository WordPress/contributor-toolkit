// The gate in front of the recursive directory removal in `sites:delete`.
//
// `sites:delete` is handed a path and calls `fse.remove` on it — the least
// recoverable action reachable from the window. The renderer is the only caller
// and every call site passes a path the app itself registered, so nothing today
// misuses it. But the renderer also displays content the app does not author:
// child-process output from an install or a build, and the site being developed.
// This module is the step that keeps any future influence over that path from
// turning "delete this site" into "remove this directory".
//
// The `sites` array in the app's store is its own record of what it created or
// adopted, so it is the boundary: a request to remove anything not in it is not
// one the app should carry out. This is the same shape as external-url.js — a
// pure check, a safe log formatter, and a wrapper whose effects are injected so
// both branches can be tested without an Electron process.
//
// There is a second, shorter-lived record: the sites this process is creating
// right now (setup-tracker.js). A site's directory exists from the moment the
// app makes it, minutes before the clone finishes and the store hears about it,
// and the two verbs here want opposite answers about it — open it, yes; delete
// it, absolutely not. So `pending` widens `revealRegisteredSite` and is an
// outright refusal in `deleteRegisteredSite`. The asymmetry is the point.

const { describeRefused } = require('./safe-log');

// True only for a path the app has on record. Exact string match, the same
// convention `sites:add`/`sites:delete` already use (`sites.includes(sitePath)`,
// `filter((p) => p !== sitePath)`): the registry stores the paths verbatim, so a
// parent, a child, or a differently-normalized form is deliberately not a match.
// Anything that is not a non-empty string is refused rather than throwing.

// any looser comparison. It is a list of directories the app is writing into,
// so a prefix match would turn "this site is being cloned" into a lever on
// everything beneath it.
