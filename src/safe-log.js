// How this app writes an attacker-influenced string into its own log file.
//
// Every guard module in src/ refuses some input — a URL whose scheme the app
// does not open, a path that is not a registered site, an application the app
// will not launch — and every refusal is logged, because a guard that trips
// silently is a guard nobody finds out about. The value being logged is
// attacker-influenced by hypothesis: that is why it was refused.
//
// Two things follow, and they are the whole of this module.
//
// It has to stay on one line. A newline in the value would otherwise let it
// write a second entry in the app's own timestamp-and-scope format, and a log
// that can be made to describe events that never happened is worse than no log.
// The control characters are escaped rather than dropped so the line still says
// what the caller actually sent.
//
// And it has to be bounded, so a very long value cannot flood the file.
// Truncation comes after escaping, since escaping is what decides the final
// length.
//
// This lived twice — once in external-url.js and once in site-registry.js, the
// second with a comment saying the third caller should be the one to move it
// here. editor-launch.js is that third caller.

// Line breaks, and everything else that would let a refused value end a log line
// and start another one.

// A one-line, bounded rendering of a refused value, safe to concatenate into a
// log message. A non-string is described by its type rather than coerced, so a
// caller that passed the wrong thing entirely reads as that in the log instead
// of as an empty or `[object Object]` value.
