// sites log strings this app wrote itself.)
//
// Nothing this module is handed is trustworthy enough to skip that. Child
// output is whatever npm, grunt or the site under development printed. Messages
// carry inbound email subjects (the `smtp` scope in main.js), paths a
// contributor chose, and the refused URLs and paths that external-url.js and
// site-registry.js escape precisely so they cannot forge an entry — a guarantee
// that only holds if this module does not undo it one caller later.

// a line the reader has no way to tell from a real one. It is handled by
// splitting rather than escaping, so a stack trace still reads as a stack trace
// — one entry per frame, each honestly stamped — instead of a single line of
// literal \n. Everything else in this class is escaped: a lone CR, an ANSI
// sequence or U+2028 begins a new line in one viewer or another, which is the
// same forgery through a different reader.
//
// This is the same escaping as `describeRefusedUrl` (external-url.js) and
// `describeRefusedSite` (site-registry.js). Those two describe a single value
// for a caller; this one is the writer itself and bounds a whole line, so the
