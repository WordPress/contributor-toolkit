/**
 * Creating a site: the clone of `wordpress-develop` through the bundled Git
 * (#385, flow 1 of phase 3 of #364). The first write the binary makes, and
 * the one with the narrowest blast radius: a repository that did not exist
 * before.
 *
 * Partial, not shallow. `--filter=blob:none` brings the whole history down
 * (commits and trees, about 57 MB for wordpress-develop) and fetches a blob
 * only when something asks for it, which a checkout of HEAD does and nothing
 * the app does afterwards needs. What that buys is a merge base for every
 * pull request without a full clone (#351), and a route `isomorphic-git`
 * never had. A shallow clone would be smaller by that 57 MB and have no
 * history at all. Measured in the #364 spike: 5.2 s for the history alone.
 *
 * The repository's own config is written at clone time, so a site the binary
 * made never depends on the CRLF view git-read.cjs synthesises for sites the
 * old engine made: `core.autocrlf=false` keeps the tree LF on every platform,
 * which is what wordpress-develop's blobs are and what the patch builder
 * assumes; `core.symlinks=false` matches what the old engine wrote; and on
 * Windows `core.longpaths=true` because the tree has paths past MAX_PATH.
 *
 * Progress arrives on stderr as the lines Git prints for a human, read by
 * `streamGit` (git-run.cjs) and parsed by git-progress.cjs, the one place
 * the app reads non-porcelain output.
