 * The writes the bundled Git makes inside an existing repository (#385): the

 * applied. Primitives
 * only, one Git command each, with no knowledge of tickets or trunk;
 * ticket-branches.js, trunk-update.js and patch-apply.js compose them and
 * own the invariants. Same split as git-read.cjs, and for the same reason: an
 * argument list is testable on an injected runner, a flow is testable on a
 * real repository, and mixing the two hides which one broke.
 *
 * Every command that touches the index or the worktree is prefixed with
 * `windowsArgs`, what git-read.cjs gives sites adopted from a host Git on
 * Windows (the `core.autocrlf` view and `core.longpaths`); a site the binary
 * cloned carries both in its own config, and off Windows the prefix is empty.
 *
 * Nothing here is a porcelain command with output to parse except `write-tree`
 * and `commit-tree`, which print exactly one object id; `checkout` and `fetch`
 * report their progress on stderr through `streamGit`, the same lines the
 * clone reads.
