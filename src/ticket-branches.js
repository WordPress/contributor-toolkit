/**
 * Ticket branches (#108). A site is the expensive shared substrate — the clone,
 * `node_modules`, the build output — and a ticket is a cheap branch on top of
 * it. Switching tickets parks the current work, swaps the worktree, and leaves
 * the substrate untouched, so starting a second ticket costs seconds instead of
 * another clone and another install.
 *
 * No Electron dependency, so `node --test` can exercise it against real
 * repositories (same rationale as trunk-update.js). Everything here runs on
 * the bundled Git: reads through git-read.cjs (#384), writes through the
 * primitives in git-write.cjs (#385). main.js owns the IPC plumbing and the
 * electron-store writes.
 *
 * Two invariants hold everything else up:
 *
 * 1. **`trunk` is never committed to.** It stays the pristine snapshot every
 *    branch is diffed against. Work that starts on trunk is carried into a
 *    ticket branch instead (the branch is created and HEAD pointed at it
 *    without a checkout, so uncommitted edits come along for free).
 *
 * 2. **A ticket branch carries exactly one WIP commit**, always reparented onto
 *    the branch point. Parking writes the commit with `commit-tree -p baseOid`
 *    and moves the branch ref onto it, rather than committing onto the previous
 *    WIP commit, so re-parking rewrites that single commit instead of stacking
 *    a pile of saves the user never asked for — the history-nobody-asked-for
 *    risk #108 flags at the end.
