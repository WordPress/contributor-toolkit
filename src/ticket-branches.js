/**
 * Ticket branches (#108). A site is the expensive shared substrate — the clone,
 * `node_modules`, the build output — and a ticket is a cheap branch on top of
 * it. Switching tickets parks the current work, swaps the worktree, and leaves
 * the substrate untouched, so starting a second ticket costs seconds instead of
 * another clone and another install.
 *
 * No Electron dependency, so `node --test` can exercise it against real
 * repositories (same rationale as trunk-update.js, whose `ensureAutocrlf` this
 * module reuses rather than re-deriving). main.js owns the IPC plumbing and the
 * electron-store writes.
 *
 * Two invariants hold everything else up:
 *
 * 1. **`trunk` is never committed to.** It stays the pristine snapshot every
 *    branch is diffed against. Work that starts on trunk is carried into a
 *    ticket branch instead (isomorphic-git's branch+checkout leaves the
 *    worktree alone, so uncommitted edits come along for free).
 *
 * 2. **A ticket branch carries exactly one WIP commit**, always reparented onto
 *    the branch point. Parking passes `parent: [baseOid]` explicitly rather than
 *    committing onto the previous WIP commit, so re-parking rewrites that single
 *    commit instead of stacking a pile of saves the user never asked for — the
 *    history-nobody-asked-for risk #108 flags at the end.
