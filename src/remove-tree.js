// Removes a directory tree, including the parts Git protects.
//
// A real Git marks its loose object files read-only, and what that does to a
// removal differs by platform — with a different hole in each default. On
// Windows, Node's own `fs.rm` chmods an entry it failed to delete and tries
// again (inherited from rimraf when core absorbed it), so the read-only file
// itself is survivable there; what has no answer is an entry something still
// holds open, because `fse.remove` passes no retry budget at all. On POSIX
// nothing clears a directory whose write bit is missing, so the same
// protected checkout fails with EACCES and no recovery of any kind. The #364
// spike hit EPERM on every packaged Windows run; the CI suite proves the
// POSIX half.
//
// Today the app mostly gets away with plain removal because isomorphic-git
// sets no attribute. Any real Git writing into a checkout changes that — a
// mentor making a commit with their own tools does — and `sites:delete`
// swallowed whatever went wrong besides (#381).
//
// The shape: try the cheap removal first, and only when it fails with a
// permission error walk whatever survived, restore the write bit, and remove
// once more. The walk is the recovery path, so the common case pays nothing.
// Anything that still fails after that propagates: the caller decides what a
// failed deletion means, this module only refuses to hide one.
