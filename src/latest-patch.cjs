/**
 * Deciding which patch on a ticket is the most recent — a pull request or a
 * Trac attachment (issue #109 / #11).
 *
 * A contributor arriving at a ticket wants to try the latest fix. Usually that
 * is a PR, and the PR list loads on its own, so the answer is known
 * immediately. Attachments load on demand (opening Trac costs the challenge),
 * so "latest" can only be judged across what is currently loaded: PRs alone
 * until the contributor asks for attachments, then both. When an uploaded patch
 * turns out to be newer than any PR, the UI says so explicitly rather than
 * leaving it buried under the attachments button.
 *
 * Kept pure and dependency-free so the comparison is unit tested without a DOM:
 * the renderer imports it, `node --test` requires it directly (same convention
 * as patch-plan.cjs / patch-sources.cjs).
 *
 * A PR used to be dated by `updatedAt`, on the reasoning that "most recently
 * touched" is usually also "newest code" — a fair trade for a comment. It does
 * not survive an event that touches every PR at once: an upstream force-push of
 * trunk restamped thousands of open PRs inside one window, and on #62064 the
 * nineteen seconds between two of those restamps were the entire basis on which
 * a patch from 2024 that no longer applies was crowned over one from 2026 that
 * does (#281). So a PR is now dated by its newest commit, resolved by
 * github-prs.js, and an unresolved one does not compete at all — falling back
 * to `updatedAt` would be falling back to the bug.
 *
 * Which leaves the cases where the honest answer is no pill rather than a
 * guess, all handled in pickLatest by the same comparison: a row that has not
 * been ruled out, and a margin too small to mean anything. The dates stay on
 * every row either way, so the contributor can still read them.

 * The most recent patch across the loaded sources, or null when there is no
 * answer worth showing.
 *
 * Only applyable attachments (patch files) compete — a .txt is context, not a
 * fix. `attachments` being undefined means they have not been loaded yet, so
 * the answer is drawn from PRs alone; that is the normal, pre-attachment state.
 *
 * Null means "show nothing", and it covers three cases, not one: nothing is
 * datable, the PR ranking is incomplete, or the top two are too close to
 * separate. The last two are the point — a pill is a claim, and a wrong claim
 * sends a contributor into an apply that cannot succeed, which costs far more
 * than the pill was ever worth.
 *
 * An undated PR does not disqualify the answer; it competes as an upper bound.
 * That single rule replaces what used to be a special case, and it is worth
 * spelling out because getting it wrong cost this feature its pill on the
 * ordinary ticket:
 *
 * - A PR the walk *ruled out* is undated on purpose — the walk stopped early
 *   precisely because its `updatedAt` was already below a resolved date. Its
 *   bound therefore sits far below the winner, and the pill shows. Treating it
 *   as "unknown, so no answer" threw away the pill in exactly the cheap,
 *   one-lookup case the walk exists to produce.
 * - A PR the walk never *reached* — the cap, a failed lookup, a cache written
 *   before commit dates existed — carries the stamp that has not been ruled
 *   out, which in a force-push sweep sits at or above the winner. The near-tie
 *   check then suppresses the pill on its own.
 *
 * So both cases fall out of the same comparison, with no flag distinguishing
 * them. A PR with neither a date nor a usable stamp is unbounded, and takes the
 * answer with it.
