/**
 * What a ticket switch is doing while it does it (issue #173).
 *
 * Switching tickets is a worktree scan and a full checkout — seconds of silence
 * on a real `wordpress-develop`, during which the window looks hung. The
 * natural responses are clicking again or force-quitting, and force-quitting
 * part-way through a checkout leaves the half-swapped worktree that
 * `withSwitchMarker` exists to recover from. This module is the vocabulary for
 * saying what is happening instead.
 *
 * Two jobs, kept together because they are two ends of one contract: the
 * throttle that decides which events are worth sending, and the sentence the
 * panel shows for one. Pure and dependency-free, so `node --test` drives it
 * directly while both the main process and the renderer bundle require it.

// A checkout of ~1500 files calls back about 4400 times in 143ms. At 100ms

// line to move, few enough that the IPC channel stays a channel.

// isomorphic-git's own phase strings, which belong to it and not to us. Pinned
// here so a version bump breaks one lookup rather than leaking a foreign

/**
 * Coalesces a flood of progress events down to what is worth sending.
 *
 * A stage change always goes out immediately — the stage *is* the sentence on
 * screen, and making it wait for the interval is what produces a line that
 * describes the previous thing. Within a stage, events are held to one per
 * interval.
 *
 * The rule that matters most is the one that keeps a line from stopping at 87%
 * and jumping to done: whatever was suppressed last is flushed when the stage
 * changes, and again by `flush()` at the end. A progress line that freezes is
 * read as a hang, which is the exact failure this is meant to prevent.
 *
 * `emit` is deliberately synchronous and returns nothing: isomorphic-git awaits
 * whatever `onProgress` returns, so a promise here would add a microtask
 * between every one of those 4400 events.
 *
 * @param {Object}   options
 * @param {Function} options.onEmit       Called with each payload that survives.
 * @param {number}   [options.intervalMs] Minimum gap within a stage. `Infinity`
 *                                        reduces a switch to one event per
 *                                        stage, for an append-only log.
 * @param {Function} [options.now]        Clock, injected so tests need no timers.
 * @return {{emit: Function, flush: Function}} The emitter and its final flush.
