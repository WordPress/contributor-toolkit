// The Git binary the app ships, and the environment it must be spawned with.
//
// Phase 1 of #364 (#383): the binary is in the bundle and nothing calls it
// yet. Every later phase reaches Git through this module and nowhere else, so
// the two things a caller can get wrong — where the binary is, and what it
// inherits — are decided once, here.
//
// Layout is delegated to dugite rather than joined by hand. It differs per
// platform in three places at once: on Windows the binary is `cmd/git.exe`
// rather than `bin/git`, the exec path sits under `mingw64/libexec/git-core`,
// and `PATH` has to carry `mingw64/bin` and `mingw64/usr/bin` or the helpers
// Git shells out to are not found. On macOS, GIT_EXEC_PATH left unset makes
// `git --exec-path` read `//libexec/git-core`. dugite also rewrites
// `app.asar` to `app.asar.unpacked`, which is the other half of the
// `asarUnpack` rule in package.json — a binary cannot execute from inside
// the archive.
//
// This is deliberately not `buildChildEnv` from npm-runner.js. That env is
// for Node children: ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE turns the spawned Electron into
// Node, and NODE_OPTIONS preloads the Windows spawn patch into it. Neither
// means anything to Git, and both would leak into any process Git itself
// spawns (an editor, a hook, `ssh`), so they are stripped rather than
// inherited.
//
// Nothing Git reads from the environment is inherited from the host either.
// dugite itself honours LOCAL_GIT_DIRECTORY and GIT_EXEC_PATH, so a host
// that exported either would swap the bundled binary for whatever it points
// at; GIT_DIR, GIT_WORK_TREE or GIT_INDEX_FILE would redirect every command
// to a repository the app never chose; GIT_CONFIG_COUNT would inject config.
// Every `GIT_*` variable is therefore dropped before dugite sees the base env
// (compared case-insensitively: Windows treats `git_dir` as GIT_DIR), and
// the ones the app relies on are set from PINNED_ENV afterwards. A caller
// that needs one more (GIT_TRACE while debugging, say) passes it as
// `extraEnv`; naming a pinned or a redirecting variable there is a
// programming error and throws rather than silently winning or losing.
