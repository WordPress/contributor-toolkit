/**
 * The provenance a handed-off patch carries (issue #166).
 *
 * The mentor handoff exists for the contributor who will not create a GitHub
 * account today: they save a patch, someone else pushes it, and the props still
 * have to land on them. That only works if the file says who made it, against
 * what, and when — so a header goes in the file itself rather than only in its
 * name, which survives exactly until the first person renames the download.
 *
 * #166 defines the format and #107 adopts it, rather than the two inventing one
 * each. Everything here is therefore about the shape of those lines, not about
 * when they are added: today only the handoff save prepends them, because a
 * patch attached to Trac conventionally carries no header and widening that is
 * #107's call.
 *
 * Prepending is safe for every reader in this app and for the ones outside it.
 * `git apply` and `patch` scan forward to the first file header and ignore what
 * precedes it; this app's own reader, `scanSections` in patch-plan.cjs, reacts
 * only to `diff --git` and `Index:` lines. `#` is the comment marker Trac and
 * Subversion patches already use, so nothing downstream has to learn a new one.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free apart from the ticket URL helper, so `node --test`
 * can require it directly.
