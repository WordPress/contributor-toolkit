/**
 * Git operations for the trunk update path (#94): the fetch-and-reset, the
 * two discards, and the reads the card needs around them. No Electron
 * dependency, so `node --test` can exercise it against real repositories
 * (same rationale as npm-runner.js). Everything runs on the bundled Git:
 * reads through git-read.cjs (#384), writes through the primitives in
 * git-write.cjs (#385). Nothing here ever reaches a git found on the host.
 *
 * The fetch asks for no depth and no filter. Every site the update can reach
 * is either a partial clone the app made, whose own config
 * (`remote.origin.promisor`) keeps the fetch partial, or a full clone
 * adopted from disk; a site the old engine made is shallow and is refused
 * before this module is called (`legacySiteBlock` in main.js), so there is
 * no site left whose history a depth-less fetch would pull in.
 *
 * main.js owns the IPC plumbing and electron-store writes; the pure
 * status-row/oid decision rules live in git-update.cjs.
