// What the app says about a merge started outside it (#352).
//
// Nothing the app runs leaves the index unmerged; a contributor's or a
// mentor's own Git does, with `git merge`, `git rebase`, `git cherry-pick`,
// `git revert` or `git apply --3way` in the checkout. While that operation is
// open, every app write that would reset the worktree refuses (main.js,
// `mergeInProgressBlock`) and the site card shows the notice, and both read
// from here so the two never drift. The app offers no way to finish or abandon
// it: the state was made at a terminal, so the sentence names the terminal
// commands that end it, per kind. Pure and dependency-free for the same reason
// as legacy-site.cjs: the renderer bundle imports it, `node --test` requires
// it, and main requires it too.
