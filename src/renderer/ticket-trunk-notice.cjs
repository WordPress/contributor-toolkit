/**
 * The ticket card's answer when a ticket predates current trunk (#305, #385).
 * The main process performs the recorded-base comparison; unknown stays
 * silent. Since the bundled Git the notice offers the move itself, one click
 * that replays the ticket's work onto trunk (`branches:rebase`), and this
 * module also words its refusals: a conflict names the files and hands the
 * contributor the manual path, which is still the way to review the result.
 *
 * @param {Object}             root0
 * @param {string|number|null} root0.ticketId Ticket currently linked.
 * @param {boolean}            root0.behind   Whether its base differs from trunk.
 * @param {string}             [root0.noun]   What the site calls its work item (#251): `ticket` or `issue`.
 * @return {{title: string, body: string, action: string}|null}
