// Which tone a status word wears, for every status in the app.
//
// The window shows status in two places and, until now, in two visual languages:
// the site header drew a rounded pill with its own green/amber pair, while the
// setup checklist wrote COMPLETED, IN PROGRESS and LOCKED as bare uppercase text
// a few hundred pixels below it. Same idea, two shapes, so neither read as the
// canonical way this app says "state".
//
// This is the single map behind <StatusBadge>. It is a lookup, not a component,
// so it can be unit-tested — the repo's split is pure logic in .cjs with
// node:test, presentational JSX untested (see pr-state.cjs, setup-steps.cjs).
//
// Note that the tones are semantic, not colours: a caller asks for a status and
// gets a tone name, and tokens.css owns what that tone looks like. Adding a
// status here should never mean picking a hex value.
'use strict';

// Every status the window can show, mapped to a tone in tokens.css.
//
// `pending` and `locked` share the neutral tone deliberately. Both mean "not
// yet", and colouring either one amber would say something failed. What
// separates them for a reader is the word and the step's own affordance — a
// locked step's button is disabled — not the badge's colour.
//
// The checklist statuses carry no label here on purpose. `setupStepLabel` in
// setup-steps.cjs already owns those words, and it makes a distinction this map
// cannot see: the same `current` status reads "Ready" before its action runs and
// "In progress" while it is running (#257). Repeating the words here would be a
// second source of truth that is already wrong. Callers pass the label as the
// badge's children; this map only says what colour it wears.
