/**
 * Why a ticket action is unavailable, and what the dirty-trunk question says
 * (#409). Every ticket action on the card (link, switch, unlink, delete work,
 * move onto trunk, the four answers to the dirty-trunk question) shares one
 * gate; the move onto trunk rewrites the checked-out tree, so it adds the
 * discard's guards on top. Each branch that disables a control has a sentence
 * here, because a disabled control carrying its reason as `title` explains
 * nothing: Chromium shows no tooltip on a disabled element and assistive
 * technology skips one with the real `disabled` attribute. `ReasonedButton`
 * in `index.jsx` renders the sentence, and is the only sanctioned way to
 * disable a ticket action: a bare `disabled=` on one of these controls is
 * the bug this module exists to close.
 *
 * Ordered like `discardDisabledReason` in `changes-note.cjs`: the action
 * already underway first, then the processes the contributor can wait for or
 * stop, so a state with several guards true reports the one that will clear
 * on its own.
 *
 * @param {{ticketSaving?: boolean, deletingBranch?: string|null, updateState?: string,
 *          installing?: boolean, building?: boolean, applyState?: string}} state
 * @return {string|null} Null when nothing blocks the action.
