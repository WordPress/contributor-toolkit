/**
 * The queue behind the app's "that worked" confirmations (#253).
 *
 * Actions used to complete silently, or leave an inline sentence the
 * contributor may not be looking at, and none of the success notices reached a
 * screen reader. This is the one place a completed action is confirmed: a
 * transient message that `SnackbarList` renders and speaks. The reducer holds
 * the list; the renderer only dispatches and paints.
 *
 * Kept as a pure, dependency-free module so it can be unit tested without a
 * DOM: the renderer bundle imports it, `node --test` requires it directly. The
 * `id` comes from a running counter rather than a timestamp or random value so
 * the reducer stays deterministic under test.
 *
 * Tone drives accessibility, not just colour:
 *   - `success` speaks politely and clears itself on a timer — a confirmation
 *     the contributor does not have to act on.
 *   - `error` speaks assertively and stays until dismissed, so it is not gone
 *     before it has been read. Supported here so successes and errors can share
 *     one mechanism (#253). The first error emitter is the site deletion
 *     that half-happened (#381).
