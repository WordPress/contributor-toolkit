/**
 * Applying someone else's patch to a checkout (issue #11), on the bundled Git
 * (#385, decided 2026-09-08).
 *
 * `git apply` decides and writes: whether the patch fits is the same question
 * the mentor who receives a patch, or Trac's committer, will ask the same
 * tool. It is all or nothing on its own (a `--check` that fails names every
 * file that does not fit, and a real apply writes nothing when a hunk fails),
 * it refuses a path outside the tree or through a symlink, and it applies
 * binary sections that carry their data, renames, mode changes and empty
 * files. What this module keeps in JS is what Git does not give:
 *
 * - the rewrite of Trac's paths to today's layout (`rewritePatchPaths`), so
 *   `git apply -p1` lands them where the preview said;
 * - a binary section with no data ("Binary files differ"), which would fail
 *   the whole patch: left out and named as skipped, as the docs promise;
 * - the wording of a refusal: which files, and inside a file which regions
 *   and why (#282, #226), from `diagnoseHunks`, which matches hunks with the
 *   `diff` package one at a time and never writes;
 * - the "that patch is not here any more" answer (#183): a reverse that
 *   fails everywhere while the forward patch would apply cleanly;
 * - a snapshot of the files the patch names, taken before the write, so a
 *   write Git left half done (an I/O failure part-way: a file held open, a
 *   full disk; verified: Git does not roll those back) is put back.
 *
 * Probed on Git 2.53 before this shape was chosen: `--check` exit codes and
 * per-file reporting, `../` (128) and symlinks refused, a missing target and
 * an existing add refused by name, stdin with `-p1`, empty adds and deletes
 * with no hunks applied, a binary section with no data failing the patch, a
 * half write left in place.
 *
 * The one thing that got worse: a CRLF file in a checkout a host Git made on
 * macOS (rare: macOS hosts seldom set `core.autocrlf`) receives LF lines from
 * Git where the old applier matched its ending. On Windows the `core.autocrlf`
 * view `windowsArgs` gives every worktree command covers it, and a site the
 * app cloned is LF throughout.
